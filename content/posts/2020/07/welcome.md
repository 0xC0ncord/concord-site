And so as of the time of writing this, my blog is now officially live. I am still adding content to my other pages and will soon add a [links](https://concord.sh/links/) page, but for now I leave any readers with this notice and a wide future of upcoming content. I also anticipate uploading the full source of the site to a public Git repository.

Until next time, see ya.
