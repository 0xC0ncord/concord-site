I'm 0xC0ncord, or just "Concord," and this site is a place where I talk to myself. I write about various information security topics. I contribute to open source projects such as the [SELinux reference policy](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy) and work in systems administration professionally. This site is the work of a personal motivation effort to share as much useful information I gather publicly, in the hopes that it will be useful. Most of my work is generally geared towards security research on the personal Linux desktop.

I can be contacted on a few various platforms, namely Matrix. I am one of the operators of a well-known [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23general:spitetech.com), but can also be reached [directly](https://matrix.to/#/@concord:fuwafuwatime.moe).
