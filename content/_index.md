## Welcome

Privacy is dead, and security is on its way out. Ignorance may be bliss, but the
consequences always catch up. Don't be part of the complacent who find it easier
to just relinquish control. Fight back and protect yourself.

Are you just going to lay there, or are you going to get up, get reading, and do
something about it?

Come on, pick yourself up.

It's a scary place out there. Make yourself at home.
